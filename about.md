![nanzhong](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/311119cba0dc9ab6309e334f53434145?s=700){: .about-avatar } I'm a software engineer at [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com), previously [Enflick](https://enflick.com), and [Flipp](https://flipp.com). I've worked all across the stack from frontend javascript to backend go, but ultimately my passion lies in building distributed systems and working on ways to improve the happiness factor of the development experience.

When I'm not in front of my computer, you will most likely find me behind my camera. I'm in love with photography, the natural beauty of the outdoors, and embarking on adventures around the world.
