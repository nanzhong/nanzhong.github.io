My name is Nan, and I'm a software engineer at [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com), previously [Enflick](https://enflick.com) and [Flipp](https://flipp.com). I've worked all across the stack front frontend javascript to backend go, but ultimately my passion lies in building distributed systems and working on ways to improve the happiness factor of the development experience.
